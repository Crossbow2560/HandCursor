This Project uses mediapipe and open cv to track hand movements and move the cursor of your computer based on it. 
Pinch with your thumb and index finger to left click.
Scroll and right click are not available at the moment but i am working on it :).
The movement is still a bit glitchy but currently in the process of smoothening out the movement.

Running the code will use your camera to track hand movements.
Run the main.py file in your local machine to start the program.

Note: Please install mediapipe before running main.py.
